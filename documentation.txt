Specification and Requirements
- Expense tracker app
- Be able to track current budget by inputing earnings and expenses and updating the current balance
        - Input earnings amount and add them to the balance
        - Input expenses, its amount and category, and deduct it from the balance
        - Inputs should inlcude the time and date it is added
        - Display the input in a list like record history
        - Display the current balance
        - Save the datas in local storage
- To make a usefull app that I can personally use to improve my financial management

Research
- add event listener for onclick of the buttons
        element.addEventListner("click/submit")
        I ended up using the .onlick function that I learned form my previous to-do app project that uses the .onsubmit function instead of event listners
        This uses less syntax and more readable
- select element input for cetegory input
        works the same as other input, by getting the element and its .value
- Getting the current time and date
- inner html for displaying the information inside the li element adding the li element to the ul
- working around local storage, getting previously saved datas and saving new datas

Algorithm
- Inputing income
- Inputing expenses
- Getting the time, date, and category of the transaction
- Recording transactions into transaction log list
- Tracking the current balance by adding income input and deducting expense inputs
- Saving list of transactions and the current balance into the local storage
- On load, get saved transaction logs and saved current balance
and display them
- Add error handling


Review
- Current balance and transaction logs values may not be in sync, 
        due to transaction logs being deleted without the function of updating the current balance, like adding or deducting its vales when removed, 
        another reason is that the current balance are only updated when the transaction is recorded and is not updated when retrieving saved trannsaction logs,
        meaning that the current balance is saved as a seperate value and the amount of saved transactions are not calculated, added or deducted to get the current balance
- It lacks the delete transaction button to delete mistaken inputs like wrong amount
        the multiple checks and error handling may make up for it by reminding the user to check the inputed infos before adding transaction
- We could also replace the add expense/income button with add transaction button and use category to determine whether it is an income or expense
        this means we will need to re-write the code for the new approach or logic but a more simple design of the ui
- What if the user accidentally input 0 in the amount?
- The app does not display cents values
